**Note:** `sklearn` package on PyPI exists to prevent bad actors to use the
name. `scikit-learn` is the actual package name and should be used with pip,
e.g. for:
- pip commands: `pip install scikit-learn`
- pip `requirements.txt` files

The aim of this repo is to implement the brownout of the `sklearn` package on
PyPI.
